# Unity3d Quickstart Project

A better starting point for a new Unity3d project than the current defaults.  It isn't much now, but I intented to add to it over time.

Gotcha!  One of the problems with copy and pasting and existing project is the project's name won't match.  So you might want to update that firs thing, Project Settings->Player .

Unity Version 5.6.3f1
Project Type: 3D

## Changes

* Project Settings
	* Player
		* Company Name = Mr. Phil Games
		* Show Unity Logo = Off
	* Editor
		* Version Controle = Visible Meta Files
		* Asset Serialization = Force Text
